- Storyboard

Open the app.

1- We ask if you want to make a small video or take a new picture.

*You can just upload one picture or one video. we want to avoid last
summer's picture and gallery of pictures! *

*We want to induce people to take pictures each moment they are using the
app. We ask if they want to make a new picture or a new video all the time
they open the app, but of course people are not obliged to do it overtime.

*1.1 They also can write something below her picture describing the mood or
describing themselves *

*2- Then choose if they want "meat , veggie , sea food or drinks" they can
choose as many options as they want. *

3- People are listed

*4- You send shakes to people. It's the same thing as sending an invite
without a place. Also you can invite for a specific restaurant or bar
nearby *

5- They receive notifications about what you did to them

6- You can chat with people . The chat is erased every 24 hours

*What you have talked was that when somebody already have a clue about what
restaurant he wants to go he can identify that, and its visible right next
to the profile picture for exemple a icon that shows that intent. *

*Ok so for now this simple brief about what is the most important to
implement right away. *
